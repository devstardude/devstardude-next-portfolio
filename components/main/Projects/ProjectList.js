          ü§ç Docthereum stores records over a decentralized network and records
          cannot be tampered with. <br />
          ü§ç It maintain the records linked to patients' Ethereum's public
          address, hence providing anonymity to the patient. And the identity of
          the patient remains confidential.
          <br />
          ü§ç Since, it maintain patients' reports anonymously, and It can't be
          traced back to the patient himself, therefore reports can be provided
          to researchers to aid in their studies. <br />
          ü§ç In Docthereum we have built a Decentralized autonomous organization
          where funds can be utilized by Decentralised voting and everyone who's
          a member gets a say in it. You can become part of Docthereum DAO just
          by Minting a free NFT inside the app.
